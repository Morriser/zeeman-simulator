# Zeeman Effect Simulator

Simulates the Zeeman effect on a Fabry-Perot interferometer.

- Element can be chosen from a library.
- Magnetic field strength, focal length and distance between mirrors can be chosen in interface.
- The code only accounts for the normal Zeeman effect.
- The code only account for energy transitions between two adjacent azimuthal quantum numbers.

The code comes with a JSON file (sources.json) where light source data can be added and modified, for use in the simulator.
